In a directed graph, we can detect there is a cycle or not in this graph using Kosarajus SCC algorithm.

Kosarajus SCC algorithm returns cycles list in a graph. Suppose there are 5 nodes 1 to 5 and Kosarajus algorithm returns
1,2,3 and 4 and 5. that means there are three cycles 1,2,3 next cycle 4 and then 5.

If we apply Kosarajus algorithm in our directed graph then if this algorithm return 5(n) list each list contains one node
that means there are no cycle in this graph otherwise there is at least one cycle.
